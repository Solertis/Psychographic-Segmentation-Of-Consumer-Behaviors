# Psychographic-Segmentation-Of-Consumer-Behaviors
Psychographic Segmentation of consumer data to generate insights of their behaviors and a predictive model for business to engage different consumer segments.

The objective of this project was a psychographic interpretation of available customer related data and product information to generate insights about the psychological and behavioral underpinnings of consumer behaviors.

•Rather than the traditional way of segmentation of using demographics,geography etc., our project takes into account an entirely different perspective of psychology and tries to extract possible associations between customer's activities and postulated psychographic feature that could serve as likely explanations for customer's behaviors.
•One of the performance goal was to build a predictive model which would help business to perform target advertisement identifying the best segment of customers.
•K-Means was used primarily to get various customer clusters from the data and then Random Forest, Decision Tree were used for feature importance and textual rules so that layman can understand what each cluster is all about.
•Data Visualization was shown so that customers could get the picture of data insights and analysis in a user-friendly manner.

Technologies used are: Python, MongoDB, SQLite, Django, Fusion Charts, HTML, Java Script
